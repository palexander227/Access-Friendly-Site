# Creating a Site Which is Access Friendly

## Description 

Using standard HTML elements like <div> and <span> allow for a considerable range of expression and robustness in their range of applicability. However, these tags
give no real meaning for the general containers they reference. Semantic HTML attempts to overcome this problem by allowing for names of elements which more explicitly
reveal the nature of their content. This is especially useful for those use cases were limited accessibility requires that an automated reader use the source code to create
an alternative to the standard visual representation of the content. 

The purpose of this exercise was to refactor the given website to feature "semantic" HTML and adjust the CSS to work properly with the new tags. Additioally, redundancies in the code 
and code which was not operating correctly were to be fixed. The overall appearance of the web page was to remain the same.

## Installation

There is nothing in this project which requires any specific instructions concerning installation. A simple web-browser should suffice for an adequate viewing of the represented "new" webpage. 


## Usage 

I have provided a link to the original webpage here: https://palexander227.github.io/Non-Factored-Page/. The original CSS is available here: https://github.com/palexander227/Non-Factored-Page.
